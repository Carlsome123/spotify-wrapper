Acceptance criteria:  • Able to create and log into an account associated with your Spotify info • Able to log out of your account • Account information is persistent (exists after exiting the website) • Provide a screen where past Spotify wraps (the entire wrap, not just a summary) can be accessed, viewed, and deleted • Provide a screen where you can delete your account
